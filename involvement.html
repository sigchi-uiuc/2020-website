        We are SIGCHI, <a href="https://acm.illinois.edu"><u>ACM</u></a>'s special interest group for Human-Computer Interaction. CHI is a multidisciplinary field within computer science that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers. We look at how technology can be designed and engineered to help humans. Despite the circumstances of COVID-19, we have decided to continue with the group’s operations online. We will mainly utilize Zoom and <a href="https://cutt.ly/sigchiUIUC">Discord</a> for meetings. Join our <a href="javascript:openModal()"><u>mailing list</u></a> for more updates this semester!
